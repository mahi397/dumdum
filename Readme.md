# dumdum

Another trial repo. Created from local system, added remote.

- remote means somewhere else, not on this computer. 

- git remote add origin https://github.com/mahi397/dumdum.git
We use this to add a reference to a remote repository on GitHub.

- git remote -v
Shows any remote repositories that I've connected to this repo.

- git push origin master
To push changes to the remote repo.

- git push -u origin master
To set "upstream", meaning this is where I want to push it by default. So in future, "git push" will suffice.
